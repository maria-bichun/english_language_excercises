### English language excercises out of a text

Here you can practice your English solving excercises generated from a text. You can paste the text you'd like to practice on into the form. In case you have no proper text at hand you can still enjoy the excercises made of The Little Red Cap by Wilhelm Grimm

Not many types of excercises available yet, but i'm going on working on this project and have plans concerning various new grammar topics. What you can practice now:

1. Past verb forms (Past Simple vs Past Continuous vs Past Perfect)

2. Passive voice (vs Active voice)

3. Forms of the verb *to be*

4. Prepositions
